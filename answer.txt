ssh -p2220 bandit{x}@176.9.9.172
privatekey connection:
ssh -p 2220 -i ./id_rsa bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org


x=0:passwd:bandit0
just single practice of ssh

x=01:passwd:boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1
just single practice of vim

x=02:passwd:CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9
the file name is '-', what a joke
vim ./-

x=03:passwd:UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK
the file name contains blanks
vim 'filename'

x=04:passwd:pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB
its name starts with .  a hidden file
ls -a

x=05:passwd:koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh
it is mixed with several files containing meaningless letters and signals
boring work

x=06:passwd:DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7
its size is 1033bytes
find . -size 1033c

x=07:passwd:HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs
hard practice of find
find / -size 33c -uid 11007
then search a long list of "Permission denied" 
until you find a file that was opened successfully

x=08:passwd:cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV
easy test of grep
grep 'millionth' ./data/txt

x=09:passwd:UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR
occur only once..
sorry
sort then find it roughly...
sadsad QAQ

x=10:passwd:truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk
complex grep question
password follows"========" and real password groups were placed at the last...
grep -a -E "={5}" data.txt
Yeah!

x=11:passwd:IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR

x=13:passwd:8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL
it reminds me...
programming is a binary world...not hex world.
hex->binaryGZIP->binaryBZIP2->binaryGZIP->tar->tar->bzip2->tar->gzip->ASCII
crazy!

x=14:passwd:4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e
use ssh private key to login, instead of password
ssh -p 2220 -i ./id_rsa bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org

x=15:passwd:BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr
nc operation:find port 22(for ssh) 30000(for level15) and 113 open
when shall I meet port113? XD
connect localhost in User:bandit14
nc -nvv(use ip&&visualable) 127.0.0.1(localhost) 30000(port)

x=16:passwd:cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd
connect a port 30001 which is not accessable
i don't really know its tricks...
maybe it send passwd with an "EOF"
but openssl s_client is strong enough ,so..
openssl s_client -host 127.0.0.1 -port 30001
>>>passwd of 15

x=17:passwd:xLYVMN9WE5zQ5vHacb0sZEVqbrp7nBTn
scan probable ports:
nc -v -z -w2 127.0.0.1 31000-32000
gain:
31960(nope) 31790(receive 0) 31691(nope) 31518(timeout) 31046(nope)
then test one by one use nc
maybe 31790, use openssl
Nice, gain its private key

x=18:passwd:kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd
boring game
the only one different line:
sort passwords.new passwords.old
then could easily find different two passwords, choose one, honey
kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd correct password, but he told me Byebye, fuck
or
w0Yfolrc5bwjS4qw5mq1nnQi6mF03bii wrong password

x=19:passwd:IueksS7Ubh8G3DCwVzrTd8rAVOwq3M5x
login bandit18 with ssh will cause "byebye"...fuck him up
let me find a new way to login!
no new way
but ssh could login with some orders done:
like:
ssh -p2220 bandit18@176.9.9.172 "cat ./readme"
funny,uh

x=20:passwd:GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
setuid binary! a new friend, its author is bandit20
when I use setuid program, my id will change into the author of setuid program!
wonderful!
./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20

x=21:passwd:gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr
setuid binary!a old friend, its author is bandit21
use nc to send passwd 20 to a port, then use suconnect to ping that port to gain passwd20
nc operation:
nc -l -p (port) < /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20 &
delieve passwd in backend
then:
./suconnect (port)

x=22:passwd:Yk7owGAcWjwMVRwrTesJEwB7WVOiILLI
learn cron
hhhhh, i found the answer
in/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh, i found:

he is not helping me, he is teaching me...
Thank you.
I gain /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
and inside is jc1udXuA1tiHqjIsL8yaapX5XIAI6i0n

x=24:passwd:UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ
i am tired.
I cheat
i found ./bandit23/test2.sh
and then steel the password

the official answer is:
there is a .sh that will automatically run all the scripts and delete them, so you just need to write a script to gain the passwd, and wait for the automatical run cycle.

x=25:passwd:uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG
write a shell to try 10000 times
actually i don't know which time i get it either
whatever

x=26:passwd:
my level of ssh is poor
fuck!
